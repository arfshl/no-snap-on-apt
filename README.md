Redirect snap transitional package to real native package on ubuntu

[List of "snapified" package](https://github.com/arfshl/no-snap-on-apt/blob/main/LIST.md)

### How you get those 'real native' package?
For amd64/x64, we get it from [linux mint repository](http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/upstream). Thanks to linux mint maintainers, they saved users freedom of choice. For arm64/aarch64, we get it from [Debian Upstream](
https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages)
